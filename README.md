# FPGA-Traffic-Light-Controller-DE10
Designed a traffic light controller using Verilog HDL on the DE10-Standard FPGA. Implemented an FSM with RED, YELLOW, and GREEN states and realistic timing delays using counters driven by a 50 MHz clock. Synthesized in Intel Quartus Prime and verified on hardware using onboard LEDs and reset input.
