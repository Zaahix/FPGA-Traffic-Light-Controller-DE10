## Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL on DE10-Standard FPGA

This project implements a real-time traffic light controller using Verilog HDL on the
DE10-Standard (Cyclone V) FPGA board.

### Key Concepts
- Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Sequential logic design
- Timing control using counters
- FPGA-based hardware implementation

### Tools & Hardware
- Intel Quartus Prime
- DE10-Standard FPGA (Cyclone V)
- Verilog HDL

### Functionality
The controller cycles through RED → GREEN → YELLOW states with realistic delays
using a 50 MHz clock. Reset functionality is implemented using a push button.

This project was developed as part of the Digital System Design (DSD) course.
